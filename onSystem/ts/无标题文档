I2C Block Transactions
======================

The following I2C block transactions are supported by the
SMBus layer and are described here for completeness.
They are *NOT* defined by the SMBus specification.

I2C block transactions do not limit the number of bytes transferred
but the SMBus layer places a limit of 32 bytes.


I2C Block Read:  i2c_smbus_read_i2c_block_data()
================================================

This command reads a block of bytes from a device, from a 
designated register that is specified through the Comm byte.

S Addr Wr [A] Comm [A] 
           S Addr Rd [A] [Data] A [Data] A ... A [Data] NA P



I2C Block Write:  i2c_smbus_write_i2c_block_data()
==================================================

The opposite of the Block Read command, this writes bytes to 
a device, to a designated register that is specified through the
Comm byte. Note that command lengths of 0, 2, or more bytes are
supported as they are indistinguishable from data.

S Addr Wr [A] Comm [A] Data [A] Data [A] ... [A] Data [A] P
